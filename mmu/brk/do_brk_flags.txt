This function is the core of brk management.

static int do_brk_flags(unsigned long addr, unsigned long request,
	unsigned long flags, struct list_head *uf)


## The 'mm->mmap_sem' had been locked before entering here.
## So, this will check the lock status. If still can get the lock, will WARN_ON:
	verify_mm_writelocked(mm);

## If the request range of [addr, addr + request) overlap with some mmapped
## VMAs, those overlapped range will be split and unmapped:

	while (find_vma_links(mm, addr, addr + len, &prev, &rb_link,
			      &rb_parent)) {
		if (do_munmap(mm, addr, len, uf))
			return -ENOMEM;
	}


## do_munmap() will unmap any overlap sub-ranges in the [addr, addr + len).
## you can refer to 'how_to_free_page_in_unmap.txt' for more detail.
