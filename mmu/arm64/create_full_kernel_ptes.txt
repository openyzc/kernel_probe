paging_init() will finish this work.

Before this function, there are three page mapping:

1. idmap for the early boot code/data calling;
2. kernel image in swapper_pg_dir and the later pages;
3. fixadd mapping in bm_pud[], bm_pmd[], bm_pte[];

Please note, during the procedure of full page tables setup, we can not
directly use these above page tables to allocate the pages for the new page
tables. We only can use FIX_PTE to FIX_PGD to store all the temporary page
tables and set those physical pages.

After all new page tables are ready, then we can update the ttbl1 with
swapper_pg_dir; Then everything is OK at that moment.
