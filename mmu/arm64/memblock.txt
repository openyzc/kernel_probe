This will be called after the setup_machine_fdt(__fdt_pointer) for FDT mapping.

setup_arch --> arm64_memblock_init()

memblock_remove --> memblock_remove_range
	--> memblock_isolate_range
	This function will return all the registered blocks covered by the range
	to be removed;
	---> 
	for (i = end_rgn - 1; i >= start_rgn; i--)
		memblock_remove_region(type, i);
	Here, those overlapped regions are removed;

memblock_add --> memblock_add_range
	--> if this is the first memblock, just modify the regions[0].base,
	regions[0].size, etc;
	--> otherwise, traverse whole memblock list, for all those overlapped
	with the added range, the adding will apply this region to separate the
	the range. The small region of added range will be inserted, the bigger
	region will also be inserted. Then finally will merge all the ajacent
	regions;
