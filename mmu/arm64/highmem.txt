1. What is HIGHMEM?

You can refer to arch/x86/Kconfig to find the NOHIGHMEM;

config NOHIGHMEM
        bool "off"
        ---help---
          Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.
          However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4
          Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of
          physical memory, not all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the
          kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
          "high memory".

So, HIGHMEM only makes sense for 32-bit address space systems;
The highmem is those physical address spaces which are not permanently mapped by
the kernel.

For 4G address space, the 0 ~3G is for user space, the last 1G is for kernel;


2. For ARM64, there is no use of HIGHMEM as its address space is 64 bits.

So, page_address_init() is NULL;

HASHED_PAGE_VIRTUAL will be defined for most systems which support HIGHMEM;
besides those architectures where WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL is defined.
