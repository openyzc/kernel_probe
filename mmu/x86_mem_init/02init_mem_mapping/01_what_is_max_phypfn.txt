The maximum physical PFN will be stored into 'max_pfn'.

This variable will be set in start_arch() :


	max_pfn = e820__end_of_ram_pfn();

	/* update e820 for memory not covered by WB MTRRs */
	mtrr_bp_init();
	if (mtrr_trim_uncached_memory(max_pfn))
		max_pfn = e820__end_of_ram_pfn();

	max_possible_pfn = max_pfn;

Of-course, if kernel support HOTPLUG memory, this max_pfn probably will be
updated to a bigger one.
