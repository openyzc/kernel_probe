This is done before the build_zonelists().

We must know the memory ranges for different zone type in one node.
That is what we will describe here.

Some memory relevant operations before this calling:

1) init_mem_mapping()

Setup the page tables for [0, max_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) on X86_64, for [0,
max_low_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) on X86_32.

2) initmem_init()

And after initmem_init(), the memory regions of a numa node had been separated
into memblock.


setup_arch --> 	x86_init.paging.pagetable_init()


	.paging = {
		.pagetable_init		= native_pagetable_init,
	},

So, native_pagetable_init() will be called.

For x86_64,
	#define native_pagetable_init        paging_init

For x86_32, there is a function 'native_pagetable_init', but both of them will
call paging_init() in the end.
