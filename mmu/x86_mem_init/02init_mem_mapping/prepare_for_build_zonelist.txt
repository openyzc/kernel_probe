To describe what are done in build_zonelists(pg_data_t *pgdat), I think some
technical preparations are needed.


1. nodemask_t node_states[NR_NODE_STATES]

This array is defined in mm/page_alloc.c;

The index of array is from enum node_states;

each element is 'nodemask_t' to represent the nodes have one attribute of enum
node_states, such as N_MEMORY;


early_calculate_totalpages() will setup the node_states[N_MEMORY] with
node_set_state(nid, N_MEMORY) when there are available pages in 'nid' in
'memblock';

2. node_to_cpumask_map[node]

The macro of cpumask_of_node(node) can get 'node_to_cpumask_map[node]';

node_to_cpumask_map[node] should be setup by numa_add_cpu(int cpu).

But it seems 'numa_add_cpu()' only called by identify_cpu() when some CPU is
bootup. It is later than build_zonelists(), so, I wonder for early bootup, this
node_to_cpumask_map[] will not make sense.
