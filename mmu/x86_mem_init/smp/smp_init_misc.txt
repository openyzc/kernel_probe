This is only to write down some information about SMP initialization.


kernel_init_freeable ->
smp_prepare_cpus(setup_max_cpus) -->
	smp_ops.smp_prepare_cpus(max_cpus) -->
		native_smp_prepare_cpus(max_cpus) : for x86
		--> default_setup_apic_routing()

Then, the following will be done:

	for (drv = __apicdrivers; drv < __apicdrivers_end; drv++) {
		if ((*drv)->probe && (*drv)->probe()) {
			if (apic != *drv) {
				apic = *drv;


The section of '__apicdrivers' is defined by these:

	apic_driver(sym) or
	apic_drivers(sym1, sym2)


And the staic variable of 'apic' are defined for x86 like these:

./arch/x86/kernel/apic/probe_32.c:129:struct apic *apic __ro_after_init =
&apic_default;
./arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic_flat_64.c:28:struct apic *apic __ro_after_init =
&apic_flat;


But in kernel, there are some 'static struct apic' defined, which one is the
right one for us?
