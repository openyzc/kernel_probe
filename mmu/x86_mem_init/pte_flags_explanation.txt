I try to provide some explanatons about the page flags.

As there are so many, and inter-relationships, it is not easy and possibly make
some misunderstandings. Please just take it as an private idea.

1. 


#define _PAGE_BIT_GLOBAL	8	/* Global TLB entry PPro+ */


/* If _PAGE_BIT_PRESENT is clear, we use these: */
/* - if the user mapped it with PROT_NONE; pte_present gives true */
#define _PAGE_BIT_PROTNONE	_PAGE_BIT_GLOBAL

#define _PAGE_PROTNONE	(_AT(pteval_t, 1) << _PAGE_BIT_PROTNONE)


We know that the mapping such as mmap() will have some VMA protection flags of
'prot', PROT_NONE is one of the 'prot' supported. When PROT_NONE is configured,
the userland can't access that mapping range. In kernel, I wonder the
_PAGE_PROTNONE is the corresponding flag.
