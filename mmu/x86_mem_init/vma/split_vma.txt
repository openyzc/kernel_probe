	if (start != vma->vm_start) {
		error = split_vma(mm, vma, start, 1);
		if (error)
			goto fail;
	}

	if (end != vma->vm_end) {
		error = split_vma(mm, vma, end, 0);
		if (error)
			goto fail;
	}



Normally, the first split_vma() will split the original VMA as two VMAs. They
are [vma->vm_start, start), [start, vma->vm_end);

The seconde will splict these two VMAs:

[vma->vm_start, end) and [end, vma->vm_end)
