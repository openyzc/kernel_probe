int __vma_adjust(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long start,
	unsigned long end, pgoff_t pgoff, struct vm_area_struct *insert,
	struct vm_area_struct *expand)


*vma: point to the VMA which will be adjusted the range for all cases excepts
the case 8;( For case 8, the *vma will be swapped with the 'next'. So, the
'next' is really adjusted.);

start + end : the range of new VMA;

*insert: After the '*vma' is adjusted/updated, this '*insert' will be inserted
to the RB tree;


*expand: only used to make sure the case is 8;


This function will update the '*vma' and return 0 when succeed.
