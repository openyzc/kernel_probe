This function will find the gap whose starting address is minimal and matches
the VM range and the alignment.


1. find the most left VMA whose rb_subtree_gap >= lenghth;

2. check the gap between current VMA and previous VMA;

3. As all left subtrees are finished check, traversing the right subtree;

4. return to the '1' for all the sub VMAs;

5. If can't find the qualified VMA, then traverse upstreaming;
