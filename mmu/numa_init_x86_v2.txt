There are some difference about NUMA initialization between x86 and ARM64.

initmem_init() --> x86_numa_init() --> numa_init(x86_acpi_numa_init)

There are no much difference when calling x86_acpi_numa_init().

The major is in numa_init().

It seems setup_bootmem_allocator doesn't make much sense on x86.
