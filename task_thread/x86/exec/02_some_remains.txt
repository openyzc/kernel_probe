The following issues are not touched now.
We will trace these after we had made the execve() process more clear on the
skeleton.

1. unshare_files()

It seems a new struct files_struct duplicated from current task will be pointed
by the local 'displaced';

2. file = do_open_execat(fd, filename, flags)

will open the binary file on the filesystem.

3. sched_exec

Should be relative to the cpu migration.
