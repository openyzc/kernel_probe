1. In Linux, thread will share the memory space as the thread leader/main
thread/process, but with a separate stack which is from the input parameter of
clone();

2. execv() will make the thread to be upgraded as process/thead leader; All the
other threads of same thread group will be killed. Please refer to de_thread();

3. For a process, a separate stack in TOP VMA space is created when kernel is
exec() this process.
