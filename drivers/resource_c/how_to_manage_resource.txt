ok. We start from pci resource allocation.

In pcie-designware.c, after root bus had been created, will call these two
functions to allocate the necessary resources:

pci_bus_size_bridges(bus);
pci_bus_assign_resources(bus);

At this time, we just skip the pci_bus_size_bridges(bus), although this
function is important and can decide what alignment of any bus resource
windows.


1. The basic resource structure in PCI

acpi_pci_root_create/pci_scan_root_bus/pci_scan_root_bus_msi ->
pci_create_root_bus --> pci_bus_add_resource

will add struct pci_bus_resource node to struct list_head resources of struct
pci_bus.

For PowerPC, the resource intialization is:
subsys_initcall(pcibios_init) -> pcibios_init -> pcibios_scan_phb -->
pci_add_resource(&resources, &hose->busn)

This resource will probably be used as parent windows through
find_free_bus_resource -> pci_bus_for_each_resource(bus, r, i) :
here, i is the resource index of the list, r is a pointer of struct resource;

Please note that the bus->resources list is the resource windows of root bus;


2. The resource assign/request

pci_bus_assign_resources --> __pci_bus_assign_resources(bus, NULL, NULL)

for the non-hotplug devices, the realloc_head, fail_head are NULL;

The assignment is from upstream to downstream. It means all the accessors
resources will be assigned at first.

pbus_assign_resources_sorted(bus, realloc_head, fail_head)
	__assign_resources_sorted(&head, realloc_head, fail_head)

here, &head is the output of __dev_sort_resources(dev, &head) for all
children under the input bus. All the resources of any child,
including the windows, will be sorted by the alignment.


--> assign_requested_resources_sorted(head, fail_head)
	--> pci_assign_resource(dev_res->dev, idx))
	--> _pci_assign_resource(dev, resno, size, align)
	--> __pci_assign_resource(bus, dev, resno, size, min_align)
	---> pci_bus_alloc_resource
	---> pci_bus_alloc_from_region
	---> allocate_resource
		---> find_resource(root, new, size, &constraint)
		---> __request_resource(root, new)

The key is find_resource(). The new only provide the resource size, the start
of this struct resource doesn't make any sense or have any impact on the final
allocated resource.
