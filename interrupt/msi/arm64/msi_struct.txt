1. struct msi_desc

defined in include/linux/msi.h;
this should be the most important structure of MSI.

msix_capability_init --> msix_map_region
will initialise part of this structure.

this struct node will be linked like that:

in msix_setup_entries():
list_add_tail(&entry->list, dev_to_msi_list(&dev->dev));

in struct device of device.h, there is a list:

#ifdef CONFIG_GENERIC_MSI_IRQ
	struct list_head	msi_list;
#endif

That is the right place where the struct msi_desc node is linked.

A macro of for_each_pci_msi_entry(entry, dev) is introduced to traverse this
list.
